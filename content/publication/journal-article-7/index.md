abstract: Earthworms have entirely soft bodies mainly composed of circular and longitudinal muscle bundles but can handle the complexity of unstructured environments with exceptional multifunctionality. Soft robots are naturally appropriate for mimicking soft animal structures thanks to their inherent compliance. Here, we explore the new possibility of using this compliance to coordinate the actuation movements of single-type soft actuators for not only high adaptability but the simultaneous multifunctionality of soft robots. A cross-linked actuator coordination mechanism is proposed and explained with a novel conceptual design of a cross-linked network, characterization of modular coordinated kinematics, and a modular control strategy for multiple functions. We model and analyze the motion patterns for these functions, including grabbing, manipulation, and locomotion. This further enables the combination of simultaneous multi-functions with this very simple actuator network structure. In this way, a soft modular robot is developed with demonstrations of a novel continuous-transportation mode, for which multiple objects could be simultaneously transported in unstructured environments with either mobile manipulation or pick-and-place operation. A comprehensive workflow is presented to elaborate the cross-linked actuator coordination concept, analytical modeling, modular control strategy, experimental validation, and multi-functional applications. Our understanding of actuator coordination inspires new soft robotic designs for wider robotic applications.
