abstract: The capillary driven flow in cylindrical interior corners satisfying the Concus-Finn condition was investigated under microgravity. The governing equation of capillary driven flow in cylindrical interior corners was established, and the approximate analytical solution was obtained. The relationship between liquid’s front position and time was derived, which was then compared with the results of drop tower experiments and numerical simulation using the FLOW-3D software. The influence of different parameters on the interior corner flow was studied. The results showed that the meniscus height decreased as contact angle increased, and increased as the radius of rounded wall increased. The influence of decreasing the contact angle on a rounded wall was greater than that on a straight wall. Our findings can be referred to designing tanks or choosing the suitable solution in the space fluid management.
