I am a PhD Student of control and robotics at [Automatic Control Lab](https://www.mech.hku.hk/exPage/kwlee/) the supervised by Professor [James Lam](http://web.hku.hk/~jlam/jameslam.html) and at [Biorobotic and Control Lab](http://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wangz/) supervised by Professor [Zheng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=2NSTu2EAAAAJ&). My research interests include soft robotics, applying control and optimization algorithms in robot, robotic system and kinematic and dynamic of robot.

I like playing basketball football.  [Lebron James](https://twitter.com/KingJames?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) and [Antoine Griezmann](https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=/antogriezmann/%3Fhl%3Den) are my favorite basketball and football player, respectively. Besides, I am interested in fishing and grasp some skills in ice skating and skiing. If you have the same hobbies or interests in my research field, please do not hesitate to [contact](contact/) me.
